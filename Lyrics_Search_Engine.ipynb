Feeling nauseous, sleeps on a mat because she's cautious. Give life or take life, that's her only options. Only if she had a magic wand, she'd go back to that night and put her clothes back on. But she can't change time, or what's growing inside. How could she love something that's barely alive? Her body's acheing, shaking, from sweaty palms, and cold sweat. Mentally exhausting like phone sex. No regrets, life or death, it's high stakes. ''cause right or wrong, it's only her choice to make.

Every slight sound she made was a pure as an angel resting on her shoulder. Every whisper she spoke, brought passion and clarity to all those fortunate enough to hear her voice. But that is no longer. Those are just stories from the past. I see the way they treat her now, the way the disrespect and take advantage of her. They used her for their own personal gain, success and fame. They tricked her into thinking it was all done for love, But really, it was done for money. They say money is the root of all evil, but I know its people. It's people who have carried out these treacherous crimes against her. It is people who have tried to suck, and nearly drained the blood of her soul. Her name is Music. She was once innocent, perfect. But now I fear for the worst. The day they drained her of all her blood, will be the day Music dies.\"],\n",
